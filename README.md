**Kakuna Rattata and welcome to our repo! We have created a MERN Pokemon Card Web Application that allows users to signup,login,search pokemon cards,adopt pokemon cards and delete saved pokemon cards. The user has the ability to rate a pokemon card and purchase it as well. Before we begin we would like to start by indulging you in some well refactored jokes.**
